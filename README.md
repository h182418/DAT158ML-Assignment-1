ML Assignment #1: End-to-end machine learning project

Introduction
Join the Kaggle competition here: https://www.kaggle.com/t/38af67c9bf26435da3488fbafe853057Links to an external site.

You will work in groups to construct machine learning models to predict the price of a house.

The competition is based on the dataset from chapter 2 in the textbook. Therefore, you will learn everything you need to complete the project by working thoroughly through the chapter.

The checklist for machine learning projects described in Chap.2 and Appendix B provides a valuable guide through real machine learning projects:

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Explore the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system
 

Requirements
In this assignment, you have to (i) get a score on the Kaggle-leaderboard, (ii) upload the code/notebook that you wrote to achieve the score you have got either on Canvas or as a link to a shared Kaggle notebook, DeepNote notebook, Colab notebook, or similar.

Note that you can submit as many submissions to the leaderboard as you want. You should submit your first attempt to Kaggle for scoring as soon as possible! This is to make you more familiar with how Kaggle works; after that, you can work on getting a better score.

The notebook you submit as a final solution for this assignment must have both comments and code to get the assignment approved.
The notebook must be structured according to the eight steps listed above. In addition, you have to include enough explanatory comments in your notebook so that it becomes instructive and useful even for people who have not read the textbook. You do not need to have code under steps 1,7, and 8, but you got to give short text summaries of the ideas in these steps.
You will be working together in groups of 2-3 students.
